<p>Today was my first day at BeCode. If you measure productivity by lines of count written, then my productivity today would be exactly 0. (Also, you are an idiot. Stop doing that.)</p>

<p>The door was open when I arrived to The Cave (more on that later). I came in and met <a href="twitter.com/xav1uzz">Xavi</a> and <a href="twitter.com/elmendalerenda">Mike</a>. <a href="https://twitter.com/semurat">Jorge</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/jjballano">Jesús</a> were remote, so I didn&#8217;t get to talk to them. There was also a guy whose name I don&#8217;t remember (sorry mate!) who is not really part of BeCode, but is working there with them. He designs his own line of T-shirts. I spent some time talking with Xavi and Mike about BeCode and what they do now. It surprised me a lot when they told me they have decided not to work for clients anymore. They told me they now prefer to do workshops, consulting and hacking, and they would like to develop a product.</p>

<p>The big WTF of the day came when Xavi kicked me in the head with the fact that Mac OS X is not case-sensititive (srsly, Apple?). He later added something about the worst thing in the world being a PHP programmer. He mentioned something after that, but I was still shocked, so you better ask him. :)</p>

<p>When I woke up, I talked with Mike about a project he wants to do for his town-hall, to give people the ability to give feedback. We discussed about his motivations, what would constitute the MVP and how some of the features made sense or not. Then <a href="https://twitter.com/luislitze">Luis</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/circun4">Sergio</a> came and we went to buy some food for lunch.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, Sergio, showed me the very starting bits of a 2D videogame he wants to do. Mike told me he is going to teach a javascript course and we decided I would do it beforehand along the week and give him feedback.</p>

<p>Then I decided to have a look to <a href="https://github.com/beCodeMyFriend/Cuore.js">Cuore.js</a> source code while I waited for Xavi to come back from the gym (I know, I know, me too. Maybe he wants to get into Gandia Shore or something). When he arrived he told me what he wants to work on for the next version (was that secret? I hope not) and explained me the high level architecture of Cuore and how ReST was full of crap and how SOA was vastly superior. He  probably still was high on testosterone and I didn&#8217;t want to get kicked again, so I just nodded and no one got hurt. We moved on to the code and paired, having him as the driver. I was surprised becaused I expected him to go much faster than what he did. Instead he took plenty of time with the code. We talked a lot about what we were trying to achieve, there was no rush at all. I decided I will be working with Xavi on Cuore for the rest of the week, too.</p>

<p>A random girl came in (remember the door was open? It remained open for the rest of the day. It turns out it&#8217;s a rule to be approachable to passing byers) asking if we(they) fixed bikes. They don&#8217;t, but they told her she needed a new wheel and where to buy it, and they offered to teach her how to replace it. She came back after a while and Luis did it. She paid back with some pastries.</p>

<p>I spent some more time talking with Xavi about his view on our so-called industry, the need to teach programming to children and other phylosophical aspects of our not-science-nor-craft field.</p>

<p>Finally, Luis and &#8220;Mate&#8221; showed us a couple of videos they had been editing of Luis doing vandal cycling in Valencia and New York.</p>
