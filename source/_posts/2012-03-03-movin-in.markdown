You probably have noticed this blog got a facelift.
I've moved from blogger to github, using a cool feature called
 [github-pages](http://pages.github.com/),
 which allows you to publish content to the web by simply pushing content
 to one of your GitHub hosted repositories and point your custom domain to it.


In order to generate the html pages, I'm using
 [octopress](http://octopress.org/). It allows you to define layouts and
 create posts by writing your posts in
 [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics). It also makes
 super easy to deploy to github, heroku or to your own hosting via rsync.

Here an example showing how this post looks like in markdown:
{% gist 1969245 %}

You can import your pages from blogger, wordpress, tumblr and a few other using
 [jekyll's blog migrations](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/blog-migrations)
 (octopress is built on top of [jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll)).
