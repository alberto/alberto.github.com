It has been one month since I started doing ruby and Rails at work, so I
 thought I'd share my experiences so far.

Here's a list of the things I've had to deal with this month:

- git
- ruby
- rails
- rvm
- rubygems
- bundler
- homebrew
- rspec
- cucumber
- capybara
- guard
- spork
- jenkins
- log4r
- rest-client
- delayed_job
- rake
- capistrano
- foreman
- daemons

You can tell I've been busy :D.

## References
Here are some resources I've found useful in my journey so far.


### Rails
- [Ruby on Rails Tutorial](http://ruby.railstutorial.org/ruby-on-rails-tutorial-book?version=3.2), an awesome introductory book for Rails. It teaches you about many of the things in the list above.


### Ruby
- <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1934356085/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=wwwsharpbites-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=1934356085">Programming Ruby 1.9</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=wwwsharpbites-21&l=as2&o=2&a=1934356085" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />. **The ruby book**.
For those who want to gain in-depth knowledge of the language.

- For hands-on ruby learning, try [rubykoans](http://rubykoans.com/) and [rubymonk](http://rubymonk.com/).
They are interactive online tutorials guiding you in the inners of ruby.


### TDD
- <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1934356379/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=wwwsharpbites-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=1934356379">The RSpec Book</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=wwwsharpbites-21&l=as2&o=2&a=1934356379" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />. A

### Git
- If you are new to git, I recommend you to read [Pro Git](http://progit.org/book/).
- For a more reference to-the-point style, check [Git Reference](http://gitref.org/)
- Finally, for a learn-by-example guide, visit [Git immersion](http://gitimmersion.com/)
