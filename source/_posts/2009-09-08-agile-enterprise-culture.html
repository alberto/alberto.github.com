What could person get elsewhere?<br />2. What would we pay for replacement?<br />3. What would we pay to keep person?<br /></blockquote><blockquote>"We should celebrate someone leaving for a bigger job that we didn't have available to offer them"</blockquote><blockquote>"If manager would promote employee to keep them [...], manager should promote him now, and not wait"</blockquote><blockquote>"Mediocre colleagues and unchallenging work is what kills progress of a person's skills"</blockquote></div>
