<div class='post'>
Here are my resolutions for the present year:<br />- Read LESS. Yes, less reading, more doing.<br />- Keep learning ruby.<br />- Practice! I'm resolved to do a kata EVERY day, one kata each month. Wanna join? Use the hashtag&nbsp;<a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=12months12katas">#12months12katas</a>.<br />- Rediscover enjoyment, on many aspects. This is a tough one, since I&nbsp;first&nbsp;need to find direction, then courage to act in consequence.</div>
