<div class='post'>
<p>This is the first in a series of posts in my quest to get my hands dirty with ASP.NET MVC framework, MVCContrib, Spark, NHibernate, FluentNhibernate, Linq2NHibernate, Windsor and a whatnot. For that, I have decided to take <a href="http://nerddinner.codeplex.com/">NerdDinner</a> for a spin (not extremely original, I know), replacing what I think could be better and extending from there. If you are interested, you can have a look at the <a href="http://github.com/alberto/altnerddinner">AltNerdDinner repository</a> on github.</p>  <p>Here is a list of the posts published so far:</p>  <p><a href="http://sharpbites.blogspot.com/2009/10/altnerddinner-part-1-removing-unwanted.html">Part 1: Removing unwanted dependencies</a></p>  <p><a href="http://sharpbites.blogspot.com/2009/10/altnerddinner-part-2-rich-man.html">Part 2: Rich Man's Dependency Injection</a></p>  <p><a href="http://sharpbites.blogspot.com/2009/10/altnerddinner-part-3-introducing-fluent.html">Part 3: Introducing Fluent NHibernate. Mapping, the easy way</a></p>  <p><a href="http://sharpbites.blogspot.com/2009/10/altnerdinner-part-4-introducing.html">Part 4: Introducing NHibernate. Because POCO is enough</a></p>  </div>
