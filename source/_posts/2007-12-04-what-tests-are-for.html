<blockquote>"Tests are absolutely not for checking to see if things went wrong. They are for articulating what code should do, and proving that code does it."</blockquote><cite>-- <a href="http://gilesbowkett.blogspot.com/2007/10/debugger-support-considered-harmful.html">Giles Bowkett</a></cite></div>
