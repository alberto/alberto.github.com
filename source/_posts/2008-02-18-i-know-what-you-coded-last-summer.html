<blockquote>At all times, I want to produce code that is readable, maintainable and simple. [...]                   [I]t is considered polite to do this in a manner that would make sense to the next developer that would have to touch this code. [...] A good suggestion that I take to heart is to assume that the next developer to touch your code is an axe murderer that knows where you live, and has a very short fuse.</blockquote><cite> <a href="http://www.ayende.com">Ayende</a>, <a href="http://www.manning.com/rahien/">Building Domain Specific Languages in Boo</a></cite></div>
