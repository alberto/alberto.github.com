I was quite shocked when I saw the logo. Look at it for a second. What do you see there?<br />It might be my perturbated mind, but I was quite shocked when I felt it was "showing me the finger". It actually took me a minute (I said I was shocked) to realize it was not <i>that </i>finger. Still, maybe that logo deserves a revamp. Just making clear the first finger is a thumb will suffice.</div>
