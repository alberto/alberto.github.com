It seems <a href="http://www.jpboodhoo.com/blog/Handling3rdPartyDependenciesIncludingYourOwn.aspx">some smart people</a> is taking the same approach I have ended up with in my projects. I still don't like it very much, but it seems the only way to go until we have a complete continous integration environment, fully backed-up by TDD, a consistent versioning policy and a tool like <a href="http://maven.apache.org/">Maven</a> to handle those dependencies for us.</div>
