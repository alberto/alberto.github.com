Eric Lippert, wrote a great post about value types vs reference types, and how, many times, the discussion is shifted to the-heap-and-the-stack, when it should really be about the differences when those types are passed (by value) as parameters.<br /><br />He nails it when he says:<br /><blockquote>Making the nano-optimization of making a type that really should be a ref type into a value type for a few nanoseconds of perf gain is probably not worth it. I would only be making that choice if profiling data showed that there was a large, real-world-customer-impacting performance problem directly mitigated by using value types. Absent such data, Iâ€™d always make the choice of value type vs reference type based on whether the type is semantically representing a value or semantically a reference to something.</blockquote></div>
