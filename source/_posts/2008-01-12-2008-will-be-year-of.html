Linux.<br />Hehe, I'm kidding. I think 2008 will be the year of <a href="http://www.agiledata.org/essays/tdd.html">Test Driven <span style="font-weight:bold;">Design</span></a>. I know it has been already there for a long time already, but I hope that it will become mainstream with the final release of the <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/10/14/asp-net-mvc-framework.aspx">ASP.NET MVC</a> framework Microsoft is releasing this year.<br /><br />Well, in fact, depending how long it takes for them to ship it, it may actually take a bit longer to be widely used tough, but I'm happy this is going to be finally adopted for web development.</div>
