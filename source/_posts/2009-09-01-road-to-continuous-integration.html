Nothing really new under the sun, but it might help a few people to get started.    <br />I will update this post with links backs to each element of the series.    <br /><a href="http://sharpbites.blogspot.com/2009/09/road-to-continuous-integration-part-1.html">Part 1: Get your source under control</a></p>  <p><a href="http://sharpbites.blogspot.com/2009/09/road-to-continuous-integration-part-2.html">Part 2: Shake your tree</a></p>  <p><a href="http://sharpbites.blogspot.com/2009/09/road-to-continuous-integration-part-3.html">Part 3: Script it, build it, test it, break it, fix it. Commit it</a></p>  </div>
